## Odin Node Basic Information Site 

# Description
This is my implementation of the Basic Information Site project from the Node course of the Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum.

This is a very basic html site running on the Node.js runtime. It consists of only 3 html pages and a catch-all 404 page for all invalid URLs.

It's an important step, albeit a small one, toward creating websites powered by my own backend.
